# Kitchen Sink Style Guide

I can't believe that I have to make one of these - because I can't find one on GitHub ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Reason

In the last century, when those of us who were calling themselves "Web Masters'" were trying to grasp how to link a .css file in the HTML <code>HEAD</code>, we would create a _Kitchen Sink_ of all the elements on our webpages so that we can style them in one shot.

These were the beginnings of the Design Systems we see today.

Now, every now and then, when I am working with a team - and before the Design System is in place, I use one to start thinking about styles. I don't even touch Figma, pfttttt.

- no SASS
- no Less
- no damn Node.js install / dependency / bloatware
- just pure HTML / CSS - like God intended

## Usage

_Of course download this repo to you local computer, first._

### if you just want to jam and get started

Open up _kitchen_sink-styleguide-head-css.html_ in your browser and have at it by inspecting an element.

### if you have a localhost

just clone this into some place where you can have access to it and have at it with your IDE

## How I use it

Here is my set up - which, no doubt, you will criticize:

- MAMP Pro [now that Apple doesn't natively support PHP (shakes fists at the sky)]
- "generic" defined virtual host
- ~~Edit with [Stylizer](http://www.skybound.ca) _thinkinkless shakes her head_~~
- ^ has been abandoned - so, I found [CSS Pro](https://csspro.com) - which, actually, I like better

Enjoy and fork it,

- john zavocki (aka, _jmzvki_, aka _johnvsc_ ... which I had to "retire" because of Visual Studio Code ...)

... and we still don't have a GitHub "apple / mac" .gitignore template ... seriously ?!?
